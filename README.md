# Anatron-Scripter-Interface

Interface for a MIDI controlled hardware analog filter effects unit called the Anatron. This interface runs through Logic X's scripter plugin - it's a very simple mapping of MIDI CCs to sliders, no magic. 

The Anatron was developed by veteran audio design engineer Derek Dearden in collaboration with multi-Platinum record producer Paul Northfield, the Anatron adds authentic analog tone and sonic effects to the sound of any instrument or melody line, or to a complete mix.
